        What is the 2077 Collective?
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        The 2077 Collective is a league of creatives, researchers, developers,
        and marketers committed to making Ethereum cool again. We're a funnel
        for individuals to come into an organized group, onboard,
        collaborate/coordinate with other individuals and work towards the goal
        of growing, educating, and promoting the Ethereum ecosystem. We believe
        Ethereum is technology for good and want to play a role in its adoption
        within and outside of crypto.

        The 2077 Collective wants to create a better future for Ethereum. We
        bring together people passionate about growing the Ethereum ecosystem
        and give them the tools they need to succeed. We're a creative studio,
        research shop, and mad science lab rolled into oneâ€”a place where
        talented people can come together to build, research, write, and create
        in ways that add value to the Ethereum ecosystem.
